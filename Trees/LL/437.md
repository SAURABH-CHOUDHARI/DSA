# üå≤ Path Sum III - Prefix Sum Approach

## üí° Intuition
The goal is to count all **paths in a binary tree** that sum to a specific target value. These paths **must go downwards** (from parent to child) but do **not need to start at the root or end at a leaf**.

Instead of checking every path from every node (which is inefficient), we use a **prefix sum technique**. This allows us to efficiently track the cumulative sum from the root and see how many times the desired difference has occurred.

---

## üöÄ Approach
We use **DFS traversal** along with a **prefix sum map** (`tail`) to store the number of times a certain sum has occurred on the path from the root to the current node.

### Key Observations:
- If `currentSum - targetSum = somePreviousSum`, then the path between those two sums equals `targetSum`.

---

## üìå Steps
1. Initialize a `Map` called `tail` to store prefix sums and their frequencies.
2. Start DFS traversal from the root, with initial prefix sum as 0.
3. At each node:
   - Add current node's value to the prefix sum.
   - Check how many times `(prefixSum - targetSum)` has occurred ‚Äî this gives us valid paths.
   - Update the map with current prefix sum.
   - Recurse to left and right children.
   - Backtrack by decreasing the frequency of the current prefix sum.
4. Return the total count.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code
```javascript
var pathSum = function (root, targetSum) {
    let tail = new Map([[0, 1]]);

    let traverse = function (root, value) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        value += root.val;
        let count = tail.get(value - targetSum) || 0;

        tail.set(value, (tail.get(value) || 0) + 1);
        count += traverse(root.left, value) + traverse(root.right, value);
        tail.set(value, tail.get(value) - 1);

        return count;
    }

    return traverse(root, 0);
};
```

## üîç Dry Run
### Tree Example
```
        10
       /  \
      5   -3
     / \    \
    3   2   11
   / \   \
  3  -2   1
```
### Target Sum = 8
### Valid Paths:
- 5 ‚Üí 3
- 5 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1
- -3 ‚Üí 11
- 10 ‚Üí -3 ‚Üí 11

‚úÖ The function correctly returns 3.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` ‚Äî We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)` ‚Äî For recursion stack and prefix map (H = height of the tree).

---

## üéØ Summary
- Leverages prefix sum to avoid checking all subpaths.
- Efficient and clean DFS traversal.
- Great use of hashmap to count paths with required sum.

üöÄ Perfect example of applying array-based prefix sum ideas to trees!




Let's walk through a detailed dry run of the prefix‚Äësum solution using a small example. For clarity, we‚Äôll use this tree:

```
       10
      /   \
     5    -3
```

with  
**targetSum = 15**

In this solution, we use a global map (called **tail**) to record how many times a given prefix sum has occurred. The idea is that at each node we compute:  

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**currentSum = (sum from root to current node)**  

Then we look for **(currentSum ‚Äì targetSum)** in the map. If it exists, it means there‚Äôs a prefix that we can ‚Äúsubtract‚Äù so that the remaining path sums to the target.

The code is:

```javascript
var pathSum = function (root, targetSum) {
    let tail = new Map([[0, 1]]);
    let traverse = function (root, value) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        value += root.val;
        let count = tail.get(value - targetSum) || 0;
        tail.set(value, (tail.get(value) || 0) + 1);
        count += traverse(root.left, value) + traverse(root.right, value);
        tail.set(value, tail.get(value) - 1);
        return count;
    }
    return traverse(root, 0);
};
```

Below is a **step-by-step dry run** of what happens. We‚Äôll show tables for each recursive call with the key variables:

- **Current Node:** The node being processed  
- **Cumulative Sum (`value`):** Sum from the root of the recursion (not necessarily the tree‚Äôs root) to the current node  
- **tail Map:** The mapping of prefix sums (and their counts) before and after processing the node  
- **Calculation:** How we compute the count at this node  
- **Return Value:** Count returned from this call

---

### **Initial Call**

- **Call:** `traverse(root, 0)` with root = node(10)  
- **Initial tail:** `{ 0: 1 }` (because we start with a prefix sum of 0 counted once)

---

### **Call 1: Processing Node 10**

| **Step**                | **Details**                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node Value**          | 10                                                            |
| **Incoming `value`**    | 0                                                             |
| **New Cumulative Sum**  | 0 + 10 = **10**                                               |
| **Check:**              | Look for `10 - 15 = -5` in tail ‚Üí tail.get(-5) is undefined ‚Üí **0** count |
| **Update tail:**        | Add current sum 10: tail now becomes `{ 0: 1, 10: 1 }`         |

Now, we **recurse** into its children.

#### **Call 1A: Processing Node 5 (left child of 10)**

- **Call:** `traverse(node(5), 10)`

| **Step**                | **Details**                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node Value**          | 5                                                             |
| **Incoming `value`**    | 10                                                            |
| **New Cumulative Sum**  | 10 + 5 = **15**                                               |
| **Check:**              | Look for `15 - 15 = 0` in tail ‚Üí tail.get(0) is **1**          |
| **Count from check:**   | **1** (this indicates that from the very beginning there was a prefix of 0 which makes the path from node 10‚Üí5 sum to 15) |
| **Update tail:**        | Add current sum 15: tail now becomes `{ 0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1 }`   |

Now, we traverse the children of node 5:

- **Call:** `traverse(null, 15)` for the left child ‚Üí returns **0**  
- **Call:** `traverse(null, 15)` for the right child ‚Üí returns **0**

After processing both children of node 5:

| **Step**                | **Details**                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backtracking:**       | Decrement the count for sum **15** in tail: tail becomes `{ 0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 0 }` |
| **Return Value:**       | Returns **1** (count from node 5)                              |

---

#### **Call 1B: Processing Node -3 (right child of 10)**

- **Call:** `traverse(node(-3), 10)`

| **Step**                | **Details**                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node Value**          | -3                                                            |
| **Incoming `value`**    | 10                                                            |
| **New Cumulative Sum**  | 10 + (-3) = **7**                                              |
| **Check:**              | Look for `7 - 15 = -8` in tail ‚Üí tail.get(-8) is undefined ‚Üí **0** count |
| **Update tail:**        | Add current sum 7: tail now becomes `{ 0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 0, 7: 1 }` |

Now, traverse the children of node -3:

- **Call:** `traverse(null, 7)` for the left child ‚Üí returns **0**  
- **Call:** `traverse(null, 7)` for the right child ‚Üí returns **0**

After processing both children of node -3:

| **Step**                | **Details**                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backtracking:**       | Decrement the count for sum **7** in tail: tail becomes `{ 0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 0, 7: 0 }` |
| **Return Value:**       | Returns **0** (count from node -3)                             |

---

### **Returning to Call 1 (Node 10) After Processing Children**

Now we combine the counts from the left and right subtrees of node 10:

- **Count from node 10 itself:** Initially, when processing node 10, count was **0** (because `10 - 15 = -5` wasn‚Äôt found).  
- **Count from left subtree (node 5):** **1**  
- **Count from right subtree (node -3):** **0**

| **Step**                | **Details**                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aggregate Count:**    | 0 + 1 + 0 = **1**                                             |
| **Backtracking:**       | Before returning from node 10, decrement tail for current sum 10: tail becomes `{ 0: 1, 10: 0, 15: 0, 7: 0 }` |
| **Return Value:**       | Returns **1**                                                 |

---

### **Final Result**

The initial call `traverse(root, 0)` returns **1**, meaning there is **1 downward path** in this tree whose sum equals **15**. (That path is **10 ‚Üí 5**.)

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Prefix Sum Approach:**  
  At every node, the running sum (`value`) is updated. We then look up `(value - targetSum)` in the **tail** map. This tells us how many times a subpath (from the root of our current traversal) has achieved a sum such that removing it from the current path would leave us with the target sum.

- **Backtracking:**  
  After exploring both children of a node, we **decrement** the count for the current cumulative sum in the **tail** map. This ensures that as we backtrack, the prefix sums from other branches are not affected.

- **Multiple Recursive Calls:**  
  The dry run shows how the recursion ‚Äúdives‚Äù into each branch, updates the **tail** map, computes local counts, and then backtracks by undoing the update in the map.

This detailed walkthrough with tables for each recursive call should help you understand how the algorithm computes the number of valid paths. If you‚Äôd like to try a dry run for a larger tree or have further questions, let me know!
