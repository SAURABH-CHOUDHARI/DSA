# Sudoku Solver - Backtracking Approach

## Problem Statement üìå
You are given a **9x9 Sudoku board** partially filled with digits `'1'` to `'9'` and empty cells represented by `'.'`. Your task is to **fill the board so that every row, column, and 3x3 grid contains all digits from `1` to `9` without repetition**.

### Example:
#### **Input:**
```
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
```
#### **Output (Solved Board):**
```
[
  ["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],
  ["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],
  ["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],
  ["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],
  ["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],
  ["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],
  ["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],
  ["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],
  ["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]
]
```

## **Approach üöÄ**
This problem is solved using **Backtracking**. Backtracking helps by recursively exploring possible solutions and backtracking when an invalid state is reached.

### **Steps to Solve:**
1. **Find an empty cell ('.')** in the Sudoku board.
2. **Try placing numbers `1` to `9`** in that cell:
   - Check if the number is **valid** in the row, column, and 3x3 grid.
   - If valid, place it and move to the next empty cell.
3. If the board is completely filled, return `true` (solution found).
4. If no valid number is found, **backtrack** (undo the previous move) and try a different number.
5. **Repeat** until the board is fully solved.

## **Code Implementation** üßë‚Äçüíª
```javascript
var solveSudoku = function(board) {
    solveBacktrack(board, 0, 0);
};

function solveBacktrack(board, row, col) {
    if (row === 9) return true;
    
    if (col === 9) return solveBacktrack(board, row + 1, 0);
    
    if (board[row][col] !== '.') {
        return solveBacktrack(board, row, col + 1);
    }
    
    for (let num = 1; num <= 9; num++) {
        let numStr = num.toString();
        if (isValid(board, row, col, numStr)) {
            board[row][col] = numStr;
            if (solveBacktrack(board, row, col + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
            board[row][col] = '.';
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

function isValid(board, row, col, num) {
    for (let x = 0; x < 9; x++) {
        if (board[row][x] === num || board[x][col] === num) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    const startRow = Math.floor(row / 3) * 3;
    const startCol = Math.floor(col / 3) * 3;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            if (board[startRow + i][startCol + j] === num) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## **Dry Run üìú**
### **Input:**
```
["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
```
### **Step-by-Step Execution:**
| Step | Cell | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1    | (0,2) | Try '1' (invalid) |
| 2    | (0,2) | Try '2' (invalid) |
| 3    | (0,2) | Try '4' (valid) ‚Üí Move to next empty cell |
| 4    | (0,3) | Try filling next empty cell |
| 5    | ... | Continue backtracking recursively |

---

## **Complexity Analysis ‚è≥**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(9^(n*n))` - Worst-case scenario where every empty cell has 9 possible choices.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - We modify the board in place without using extra memory.

---

## **Edge Cases ‚úÖ**
‚úî Already solved board ‚Üí Return as is.
‚úî Nearly empty board ‚Üí Solve from scratch.
‚úî No valid solution ‚Üí Algorithm correctly backtracks.

---

## **Advantages of this Approach üöÄ**
- Uses **Backtracking** efficiently.
- Ensures Sudoku rules are **strictly followed**.
- **Optimized** by skipping filled cells and checking 3x3 grids.
