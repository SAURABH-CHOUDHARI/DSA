# 🔄 Reverse Nodes in K-Group

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list in groups of size `k`, and return the modified list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, leave the remaining nodes as is.

## 🏆 Example

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
Explanation: The first three nodes are reversed, and the remaining two are left as they are.
```

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,6,5]
```

## 💡 Intuition

1. We need to reverse every group of `k` nodes.
2. If the remaining nodes are **less than **``, they stay as they are.
3. We can **use recursion** or **iteration** to solve this.

## 🛠 Recursive Approach

### 🔄 Steps

1. Count `k` nodes ahead.
2. If there are `k` nodes, reverse them.
3. Connect the last node of the reversed group to the next group (recursively solved).
4. Return the new head.

### 📝 Code

```javascript
var reverseKGroup = function (head, k) {
    if (!head) return null;

    let count = 0;
    let temp = head;

    while (temp && count < k) {
        temp = temp.next;
        count++;
    }

    if (count == k) {
        let prev = null, cur = head, next = null;
        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            next = cur.next;
            cur.next = prev;
            prev = cur;
            cur = next;
        }
        head.next = reverseKGroup(cur , k)
        return prev;
    }
    return head;
};
```

### ⏳ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n/k)`, due to recursive stack calls.

## 🛠 Iterative Approach

### 🔄 Steps

1. Use a dummy node for easy handling.
2. Identify `k` nodes ahead.
3. Reverse the `k` nodes using three-pointers.
4. Connect the last node of the reversed group to the next.
5. Continue the process until the end.

### 📝 Code

```javascript
var reverseKGroup = function (head, k) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let prevGroupEnd = dummy;
    
    while (true) {
        let kth = prevGroupEnd;
        for (let i = 0; i < k && kth; i++) {
            kth = kth.next;
        }
        if (!kth) break;

        let prev = kth.next;
        let cur = prevGroupEnd.next;

        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            let next = cur.next;
            cur.next = prev;
            prev = cur;
            cur = next;
        }
        let temp = prevGroupEnd.next;
        prevGroupEnd.next = prev;
        prevGroupEnd = temp;
    }
    return dummy.next;
};
```

### ⏳ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, as we process each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since no extra memory is used.

## 🔬 Dry Run (Recursive Example)

### 🎯 Input: `[1,2,3,4,5]`, `k=3`

#### Step-by-Step Execution

```
Step 1: Count `k=3` nodes [✔️]
Step 2: Reverse first 3 nodes → [3,2,1,4,5]
Step 3: Call recursion on remaining [4,5]
Step 4: Less than `k` nodes, return as is.
Final Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered

- **k = 1** → No change in list.
- **List length < k** → No reversal.
- **Perfect multiples of k** → Full reversal groups.
- **List length is exactly k** → Fully reversed.

## 🎯 Summary

- **Recursive Approach**: Easy to write but uses extra memory.
- **Iterative Approach**: More efficient as it avoids recursion.

Pick the best approach based on performance and readability! 🚀🔥
