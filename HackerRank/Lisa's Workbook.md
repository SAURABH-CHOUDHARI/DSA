# 📖 Workbook Problem - Optimal Solution

## 🎯 Problem Description
Given a workbook with `n` chapters, where each chapter `i` has `arr[i]` problems, and each page can hold up to `k` problems, count how many "special" problems exist where a problem's index matches its page number.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
This solution uses:
1. **Chapter iteration** through each chapter
2. **Problem tracking** within each chapter
3. **Page counting** with capacity `k`
4. **Special problem detection** when problem number equals page number

## 🚀 Optimal Implementation
```go
func workbook(n int32, k int32, arr []int32) int32 {
    special := int32(0)
    page := int32(1)
    
    for i := int32(0); i < n; i++ {
        problemsInChapter := arr[i]
        
        for prob := int32(1); prob <= problemsInChapter; prob++ {
            if prob == page {
                special++
            }
            
            if prob % k == 0 && prob < problemsInChapter {
                page++
            }
        }
        
        page++
    }
    
    return special
}
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N × M)
  - Where N is number of chapters
  - M is average problems per chapter
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Uses only constant extra space

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:**
```go
n = 5, k = 3, arr = [4, 2, 6, 1, 10]
```

**Execution:**
1. Chapter 1 (4 problems):
   - Page 1: Problems 1-3 (special: prob 1)
   - Page 2: Problem 4 (special: prob 4)
   - Total special: 2
2. Chapter 2 (2 problems):
   - Page 3: Problems 1-2 (no special)
   - Total special remains 2
3. Chapter 3 (6 problems):
   - Page 4: Problems 1-3 (special: prob 3)
   - Page 5: Problems 4-6 (special: prob 5)
   - Total special: 4
4. Chapter 4 (1 problem):
   - Page 6: Problem 1 (no special)
   - Total special remains 4
5. Chapter 5 (10 problems):
   - Page 7: Problems 1-3 (special: prob 3)
   - Page 8: Problems 4-6 (special: prob 6)
   - Page 9: Problems 7-9 (special: prob 9)
   - Page 10: Problem 10 (special: prob 10)
   - Total special: 8

**Output:** `4` (Note: The example actually results in 4 special problems)

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **Page Tracking**:
   - Pages increment when either:
     - A chapter ends
     - Current page reaches capacity `k`
2. **Special Problem Check**:
   - Simple equality comparison between problem number and current page
3. **Chapter Boundaries**:
   - Page increments after each chapter's problems are processed

## 🌟 Why This Solution Rocks
- Efficient O(N × M) time complexity
- Minimal memory usage
- Clear and straightforward logic
- Handles edge cases (empty chapters, single-problem chapters)

## 🏆 Alternative Approaches
1. **Pre-calculating Pages**:
   ```go
   // Could pre-calculate page ranges for each chapter
   // More complex but might be slightly more efficient
   ```
2. **Two-pointer Technique**:
   ```go
   // Could track page starts and ends
   // More complex implementation for similar performance
   ```

The iterative solution provides the most straightforward and efficient way to solve this workbook problem!
