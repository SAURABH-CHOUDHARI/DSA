# 🏆 Hamming Weight (Number of 1 Bits)

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given an unsigned integer `n`, return the **number of '1' bits** in its binary representation. This is also known as the **Hamming Weight**.

### 📝 Example:
```javascript
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which has `3` ones.
```

```javascript
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The binary representation of `128` is `10000000`, which has `1` one.
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach
We use **Bit Manipulation** to efficiently count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `n`. The key observation here is:

> `n & (n - 1)` removes the **rightmost 1-bit** from `n`.

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Initialize `count = 0` to store the number of `1`s.
2. While `n` is not `0`, perform the following:
   - Use `n & (n - 1)`, which removes the rightmost `1` bit in `n`.
   - Increment `count`.
3. Repeat the process until `n` becomes `0`.
4. Return the `count`.

### 📝 Code Implementation
```javascript
var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    let count = 0;
    while(n > 0){
        n = n & (n-1); // Remove the rightmost 1-bit
        count++;
    }
    return count;
};
```

## 📊 Dry Run
Let's dry-run the algorithm with an example:

### Example: `n = 11 (1011 in binary)`

| Iteration | `n` (Binary) | `n-1` (Binary) | `n & (n-1)` | Count |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| 1         | 1011        | 1010           | 1010        | 1     |
| 2         | 1010        | 1001           | 1000        | 2     |
| 3         | 1000        | 0111           | 0000        | 3     |

👉 The loop stops when `n = 0`, and the final count is `3`.

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we use only a few variables.

---

## ✅ Summary
🔹 We use **bitwise AND (`n & (n-1)`)** to remove the rightmost `1` bit efficiently.  
🔹 The number of operations is **equal to the number of `1`s** in the binary representation.  
🔹 **Efficient approach** compared to naive bit-checking methods.

🚀 This method is optimal for counting bits and widely used in competitive programming! 🎯
