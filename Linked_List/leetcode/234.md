# 📝 Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.

## 🔍 Example

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

1. **Use Two Pointers (Slow & Fast)**: Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time to find the middle of the linked list.
2. **Reverse the First Half**: Reverse the first half of the linked list while finding the middle.
3. **Handle Odd-Length Lists**: If the list has an odd number of elements, move `slow` one step forward to skip the middle element.
4. **Compare the Two Halves**: Traverse both halves and check if they are identical.

## 📝 Code Implementation

```javascript
var isPalindrome = function(head) {
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    let prev = null;
    
    // Step 1: Find the middle of the list while reversing the first half
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        const temp = slow.next;
        slow.next = prev;
        prev = slow;
        slow = temp;
    }
    
    // Step 2: If the list has an odd number of elements, skip the middle node
    if (fast) {
        slow = slow.next;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Compare the reversed first half with the second half
    while (slow && prev) {
        if (slow.val !== prev.val) {
            return false;
        }
        slow = slow.next;
        prev = prev.next;
    }
    return true;
};
```

## 🛠 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we modify the list in place without extra storage.

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered

- The list is empty (`head == null`).
- The list has only one node (which is always a palindrome).
- The list has an odd or even number of elements.
- All elements are the same.
- The list is not a palindrome.

## 🎯 Summary

This function efficiently determines whether a given linked list is a palindrome using the two-pointer technique and in-place reversal. 🚀
