# 📏 Largest Rectangle in Histogram

## Problem Statement
Given an array `heights` representing the heights of bars in a histogram where the width of each bar is `1`, find the area of the **largest rectangle** that can be formed using consecutive bars.

### Example:
**Input:**
```js
heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
```
**Output:**
```js
10
```
**Explanation:**
- The largest rectangle is formed using heights `[5,6]` with width `2` and height `5`, giving an area of `5 * 2 = 10`.

## 🚀 Approach: Using Monotonic Stack

### 🔥 Intuition
To efficiently find the largest rectangle:
- We **use a monotonic increasing stack** to track indices of bars.
- Whenever we encounter a **shorter height** (or reach the end), we calculate **maximum possible area** for previously stored heights.

### 🛠 Steps:
1. **Iterate through heights**, pushing indices onto the stack.
2. When a **smaller height is encountered** (or end is reached):
   - Pop stack to get **height**.
   - Compute **width** using previous index.
   - Update **max area**.
3. Continue until all bars are processed.

## 💻 Implementation
```js
var largestRectangleArea = function (heights) {
    let st = [];  // Monotonic increasing stack
    let max = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i <= heights.length; i++) {
        while (st.length > 0 && (i === heights.length || heights[i] <= heights[st[st.length - 1]])) {
            const h = heights[st.pop()];
            const w = st.length === 0 ? i : i - st[st.length - 1] - 1;
            max = Math.max(max, h * w);
        }
        st.push(i);
    }
    return max;
};
```

## 📜 Dry Run Example
**Input:**
```js
heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
| Step | i | Stack | Height Popped | Width | Max Area |
|------|---|--------|---------------|-------|----------|
| 1    | 0 | `[0]`  | -             | -     | 0        |
| 2    | 1 | `[1]`  | `2`           | `1`   | 2        |
| 3    | 2 | `[1,2]`| -             | -     | 2        |
| 4    | 3 | `[1,2,3]`| -           | -     | 2        |
| 5    | 4 | `[1,4]`| `6,5`         | `1,2` | 10       |
| 6    | 5 | `[1,4,5]`| -           | -     | 10       |
| 7    | 6 | `[1]`  | `3,2,1`       | `4,5,6` | 10      |

**Final Output:** `10`

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` (Each element is pushed and popped once)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` (Stack stores at most `N` elements)

## 🔥 Why is this Efficient?
✔ **Uses Stack** to process bars efficiently.
✔ **Avoids Brute Force** `O(N²)` complexity.
✔ **One Pass Solution** maintains linear time complexity.
