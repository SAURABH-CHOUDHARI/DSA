# ✨ Check if a Number is a Power of Three

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, determine whether it is a **power of three**. A number is a power of three if it can be expressed as `3^x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer.

## 💪 Examples

```javascript
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 3^3
```

```javascript
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: 0 is not a power of three.
```

```javascript
Input: n = 9
Output: true
Explanation: 9 = 3^2
```

```javascript
Input: n = 45
Output: false
Explanation: 45 is not a power of three.
```

## 🛠️ Solution Approach
### 🔄 Iterative Approach
1. **Handle Edge Case:** If `n` is exactly `1`, return `true` because `3^0 = 1`.
2. **Check for Divisibility:** If `n` is divisible by `3`, we iteratively multiply `3` until it either equals `n` or surpasses it.
3. **Final Check:** If we reach `n` exactly, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## 📝 Implementation

```javascript
var isPowerOfThree = function (n) {
    if (n === 1) {
        return true;
    }
    if (n % 3 === 0) {
        let result = 3;
        while (result < n) {
            result *= 3;
        }
        if (result === n) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

### ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`, since we are multiplying `3` iteratively.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we are using only a few extra variables.

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- `n = 1` (Base case where `3^0 = 1`)
- `n = 0` (Should return `false` as `0` is not a power of three)
- `n = -3` (Negative numbers are not valid powers of three)
- Large values of `n`

This solution effectively determines whether `n` is a power of three in an efficient manner! ✨
