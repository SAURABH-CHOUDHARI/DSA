# ⬇️ Bottom-Up Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree

## 💡 Intuition
While a standard level order traversal collects nodes level by level from top to bottom, a **bottom-up traversal** returns the levels starting from the bottom-most to the root.

The goal is to traverse the tree in **BFS (level order)** fashion and store each level's values in a list. Instead of appending to the result, we **prepend** the level data so that we get the bottom level first.

---

## 🚀 Approach
1. Initialize an empty result array.
2. Use a queue to perform level order traversal (BFS).
3. For each level:
   - Create a temporary array to store values.
   - Iterate through the nodes at that level.
   - Add child nodes to the queue for the next level.
   - Prepend the level array to the result.
4. Return the result array after traversal.

---

## 📌 Steps
1. If the tree is empty, return an empty array.
2. Initialize a queue with the root node.
3. Traverse level by level:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level.
   - For each node, extract its value and enqueue its children.
   - Use `unshift()` to add the current level at the beginning of the result array.
4. Return the result.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var levelOrderBottom = function(root) {
     let result = [];
     if (!root) return result;
 
     let q = [root];
 
     while (q.length > 0) {
         let size = q.length;
         let level = [];

         for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
             let node = q.shift();
             level.push(node.val);

             if (node.left) q.push(node.left);
             if (node.right) q.push(node.right);
         }

         result.unshift(level); 
     }

     return result;  
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Tree Example:
```
        3
       / \
      9  20
         /  \
        15   7
```
### Traversal:
- Level 0: [3]
- Level 1: [9, 20]
- Level 2: [15, 7]

🔚 Final Output (bottom-up): `[[15, 7], [9, 20], [3]]`

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` — Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` — For the queue and result array.

---

## 🎯 Summary
- Performs BFS and prepends each level's result.
- Efficient and concise solution for bottom-up level order traversal.
