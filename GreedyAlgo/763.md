# ✂️ Partition Labels

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, partition it into as many parts as possible such that each letter appears in at most one part. Return the sizes of these partitions.

### Example
```javascript
Input: "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
Partitions are "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij"
Each letter appears in only one partition
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach

### Greedy Algorithm
1. **Last Occurrence Mapping**: Store the last index of each character
2. **Window Expansion**: Expand partition boundaries as we encounter characters with later last occurrences
3. **Partition Creation**: When current index matches partition end boundary, record partition size

## 💻 Code Implementation

```go
func partitionLabels(s string) []int {
    // Store last occurrence index of each character
    lastOccurrence := make(map[rune]int)
    for i, char := range s {
        lastOccurrence[char] = i
    }

    result := []int{}
    partitionStart := 0
    partitionEnd := 0

    for i, char := range s {
        // Expand partition end if current character's last occurrence is later
        if lastOccurrence[char] > partitionEnd {
            partitionEnd = lastOccurrence[char]
        }

        // When we reach partition end, record its size
        if i == partitionEnd {
            result = append(result, i-partitionStart+1)
            partitionStart = i + 1
        }
    }

    return result
}
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N)  
  (Two passes through the string)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)  
  (Fixed-size map for alphabet characters)

## 🏁 Example Walkthrough

### Input: `"abacdc"`
1. Last occurrences: {'a':2, 'b':1, 'c':5, 'd':4}
2. Iteration:
   - i=0 ('a'): partitionEnd=2
   - i=1 ('b'): partitionEnd remains 2
   - i=2 ('a'): partitionEnd=2 → partition [0:2] → size=3
   - i=3 ('c'): partitionEnd=5
   - i=4 ('d'): partitionEnd=5
   - i=5 ('c'): partitionEnd=5 → partition [3:5] → size=3
3. **Output**: [3,3]

## ✅ Edge Cases Handled

- **Single character**: "a" → [1]
- **All unique**: "abcdef" → [1,1,1,1,1,1]
- **All same**: "aaaaa" → [5]
- **Empty string**: "" → []
- **Unicode characters**: Handled via rune type

## 🎯 Optimization Notes

- **Single pass possible**: Can merge the two passes with tracking
- **Early termination**: Not applicable (must process entire string)
- **Memory efficient**: Only stores necessary last indices

## 🚀 Alternative Approaches

1. **Merge Intervals**:
   ```go
   // Create intervals for each character's first/last occurrence
   // Merge overlapping intervals
   // More complex but same asymptotic complexity
   ```
2. **Stack-Based**:
   ```go
   // Use stack to track active partitions
   // Less intuitive but similar performance
   ```

This implementation provides an optimal O(N) solution that efficiently partitions strings while maintaining readability.
