# 📝 Remove Linked List Elements

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that have `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.

## 🔍 Example

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

1. **Remove leading nodes**: If the head node itself contains `val`, keep updating `head` to `head.next` until `head` does not contain `val`.
2. **Iterate through the list**: Use a pointer `cur` to traverse the list and remove nodes where `cur.next.val == val`.
3. **Return the updated head**: After all removals, return the modified head of the list.

## 📝 Code Implementation

```javascript
var removeElements = function(head, val) {
    // Remove leading nodes with the target value
    while(head != null && head.val == val){
        head = head.next;
    }
    
    let cur = head;
    // Traverse the list and remove matching elements
    while(cur != null  && cur.next != null){
        if(cur.next.val == val){
            cur.next = cur.next.next;
        } else {
            cur = cur.next;
        }
    }
    
    return head;
};
```

## 🛠 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are modifying the list in place without using extra space.

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered

- The list is empty (`head == null`).
- All nodes contain `val` and should be removed.
- `val` is not present in the list.
- `val` is only present at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.

## 🎯 Summary

This function efficiently removes all occurrences of `val` from the linked list while maintaining optimal space and time complexity. 🚀
