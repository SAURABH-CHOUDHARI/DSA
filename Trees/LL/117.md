# 🌲 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II (Constant Space)

## 💡 Intuition
This solution addresses the problem of connecting `next` pointers in a binary tree **without using extra space** for queues or recursion stack. It uses a technique often referred to as **constant space level traversal**, utilizing the `next` pointers established in previous levels to traverse the tree.

---

## 🚀 Approach
We traverse the tree **level by level**, connecting child nodes of each level using a **dummy node** and a **tail pointer**. Once a level is fully connected, we move to the next level using the connections just made.

---

## 📌 Steps
1. Initialize `curr` with the `root`.
2. While `curr` is not null:
   - Create a dummy node that serves as a placeholder for building the `next` level.
   - Use a tail pointer (`tail`) starting at the dummy node.
   - Traverse the current level using the `next` pointers:
     - For each `curr`, connect its left child to `tail.next` if it exists, and move the tail.
     - Do the same for the right child.
     - Move `curr` to `curr.next`.
   - Move `curr` to the `dummy.next`, i.e., the first node in the next level.
3. Continue until all levels are processed.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var connect = function (root) {
    if (!root) return root;
    let curr = root;

    while (curr) {
        let dummy = new _Node(0);
        let tail = dummy;

        while (curr) {
            if (curr.left) {
                tail.next = curr.left;
                tail = tail.next;
            }
            if (curr.right) {
                tail.next = curr.right;
                tail = tail.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        curr = dummy.next;
    }

    return root;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Tree:
```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \     \
   4   5     7
```
### After Running:
```
Level 1: 1 → null
Level 2: 2 → 3 → null
Level 3: 4 → 5 → 7 → null
```

✅ Each node is now connected to its next right node.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` — Every node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — Only a few pointers are used (no recursion or queue).

## 📊 BFS vs Constant Space DFS (This Solution)
| Feature               | BFS Approach      | Constant Space Approach |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Space Usage          | O(N) (queue)      | O(1)                     |
| Traversal Type       | Level Order (BFS) | Simulated Level Traversal |
| Real-World Use       | Simpler to write  | Memory-efficient         |

---

## 🎯 Summary
- This is a clean, constant-space solution.
- Ideal when memory usage matters.
- Uses `next` pointers themselves to manage traversal without auxiliary structures.

🧠 A beautiful trick to reduce space complexity while preserving the essence of level-order traversal!
