# 🔍 Minimum Window Substring

## 💡 Problem
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`. If there is no such window, return the empty string `""`.

---

## 💭 Intuition
Use the **sliding window** technique combined with a **hash map** to count required characters and track when all characters in `t` have been found in a current window of `s`. The goal is to shrink the window as small as possible while maintaining all characters from `t`.

---

## 🚀 Approach

### 📌 Steps
1. Count frequency of each character in `t` using a hash map.
2. Initialize window pointers `i` and `j` to 0.
3. Slide the right pointer `j` to include characters into the window.
4. If a character in `s[j]` is in `t`, decrement its count in the map.
5. When all characters are found (tracked using `count`), try shrinking the window by incrementing `i` and updating the result if the window is smaller.
6. Continue until the entire string is traversed.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var minWindow = function (s, t) {
    if (s.length < t.length) return "";
    if (s == t) return s;

    let map = new Map();

    for (let ch of t) {
        map.set(ch, (map.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
    };

    let minLength = Infinity, minStart = 0, count = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
    while (j < s.length) {

        let ch = s.charAt(j)

        if (map.has(ch)) {
            map.set(ch, map.get(ch) - 1);
            if (map.get(ch) >= 0) count++;
        };

        while (count == t.length) {

            if (minLength > j - i + 1) {
                minLength = j - i + 1;
                minStart = i;
            };

            let ch1 = s.charAt(i);

            if (map.has(ch1)) {
                map.set(ch1, map.get(ch1) + 1);
                if (map.get(ch1) > 0) count--;
            };
            i++;
        };
        j++;
    };
    if (minLength === Infinity) return "";
    return s.substring(minStart, minStart + minLength);
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Input:
```js
s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
```

### Execution:
- Characters to find: {A:1, B:1, C:1}
- Start expanding window until all chars are found
- Then try to contract while still maintaining all chars
- Final answer: `"BANC"`

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of `s`. Each character is visited at most twice (once by `j` and once by `i`).
- **Space Complexity:** O(K), where K is the number of unique characters in `t`.

---

## 📘 Summary
- Sliding window + hash map is a powerful combo for substring problems.
- Optimize window size while tracking necessary character counts.
- Efficient and elegant approach with linear time complexity.
