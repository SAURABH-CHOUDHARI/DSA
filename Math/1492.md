# 🔢 Kth Factor of N

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, return the kth smallest factor of `n`, or `-1` if `n` has fewer than `k` factors.

### Example
```javascript
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors of 12 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd is 3
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach

### Efficient Factorization
1. **Factor Collection**:
   - Iterate up to √n to find factor pairs
   - Store both divisors of each pair
2. **Sorting & Selection**:
   - Sort collected factors in ascending order
   - Return the kth element or -1 if not enough factors

## 💻 Code Implementation

```javascript
var kthFactor = function(n, k) {
    const factors = [];
    
    // Find all factors up to sqrt(n)
    for (let i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            factors.push(i);
            // Avoid duplicate for perfect squares
            if (i !== n / i) {
                factors.push(n / i);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Sort factors in ascending order
    factors.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Return kth factor or -1
    return factors.length < k ? -1 : factors[k - 1];
};
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(√N + F log F)  
  (F = number of factors, typically small)
- **Space Complexity**: O(F)  
  (Storage for factors)

## 🏁 Example Walkthrough

### Input: `n = 30`, `k = 4`
1. Find factors:
   - 1 (pair with 30)
   - 2 (pair with 15)
   - 3 (pair with 10)
   - 5 (pair with 6)
   - Stop at √30 ≈ 5.47
2. Collected factors: [1,30,2,15,3,10,5,6]
3. Sorted: [1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30]
4. **4th factor**: 5

## ✅ Edge Cases Handled

- **Prime numbers**: n=7 → [1,7]
- **k too large**: Returns -1
- **Perfect squares**: n=16 → [1,2,4,8,16]
- **k=1**: Always returns 1
- **n=1**: Single factor [1]

## 🎯 Optimization Notes

- **Early termination**: Could exit after finding k factors
- **Memory efficient**: Only stores necessary factors
- **Duplicate prevention**: Handles perfect squares properly

## 🚀 Alternative Approaches

1. **Linear Search**:
   ```javascript
   // Check every number up to n
   // O(N) time but simpler code
   ```
2. **Two Arrays**:
   ```javascript
   // Store small and large factors separately
   // Avoids sorting but more complex
   ```
3. **Math Optimization**:
   ```javascript
   // Use number properties to predict factors
   // Advanced mathematical approach
   ```

This implementation provides a balanced solution that efficiently finds factors while handling all edge cases, making it suitable for typical problem constraints.
