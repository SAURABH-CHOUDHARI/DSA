# Add Two Numbers - Linked List Representation

## Problem Statement
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Approach
We traverse both linked lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition. The result is stored in a new linked list. If there is a carry left at the end, we add a new node for it.

## Algorithm Explanation 🚀
1. **Initialize a Dummy Node:**
   - We use a dummy node (`List`) to help build the result linked list easily.
   - A `head` pointer is used to traverse the list.
   
2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `sum` to store the sum of digits at the current position.
   - `carry` to store carry-over if the sum exceeds 9.

3. **Traverse Both Lists:**
   - While at least one of the lists has remaining nodes or there's a carry:
     - Add the corresponding values from `l1` and `l2` (if present).
     - If the sum is `>= 10`, set `carry = 1` and adjust `sum`.
     - Create a new node with the sum and attach it to the result.
     - Move the `head` forward and reset `carry`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The first node of `List` is a dummy node, so we return `List.next`.

## Code Implementation
```javascript
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    var List = new ListNode(0);
    var head = List;
    var sum = 0;
    var carry = 0;

    while(l1 !== null || l2 !== null || sum > 0) {
        if (l1 !== null) {
            sum += l1.val;
            l1 = l1.next;
        }
        if (l2 !== null) {
            sum += l2.val;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        if (sum >= 10) {
            carry = 1;
            sum -= 10;
        }

        head.next = new ListNode(sum);
        head = head.next;

        sum = carry;
        carry = 0;
    }

    return List.next;
};
```

## Dry Run Example 🔍
### Input:
```
l1 = [2 -> 4 -> 3]  (represents 342)
l2 = [5 -> 6 -> 4]  (represents 465)
```
### Step-by-Step Execution:
| Iteration | l1.val | l2.val | Sum  | Carry | New Node |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|-------|----------|
| 1         | 2      | 5      | 7    | 0     | 7        |
| 2         | 4      | 6      | 10   | 1     | 0        |
| 3         | 3      | 4      | 8    | 0     | 8        |

### Output:
```
[7 -> 0 -> 8] (represents 807)
```

## Complexity Analysis 📊
- **Time Complexity:** `O(max(m, n))` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `l1` and `l2`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(max(m, n))` (new linked list stores the result).

---

## Edge Cases ✅
- One list is longer than the other.
- Carry remains at the last digit.
- One of the lists is empty.
- Both lists contain a single node with value `0` (should return `[0]`).

This approach efficiently adds two numbers using linked lists while maintaining `O(1)` extra space apart from the result list. 🚀
