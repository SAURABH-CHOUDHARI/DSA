# 🚀 Check if a Number is a Power of Two

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, determine whether it is a power of **two**.

A number is a power of two if it can be written as `2^x` where `x` is a non-negative integer.

## 🏆 Examples

```javascript
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 16 = 2^4
```

```javascript
Input: n = 5
Output: false
Explanation: 5 is not a power of two.
```

```javascript
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 = 2^0
```

---

## 🛠 Approach
1. **Edge Case**: If `n == 1`, return `true` since `2^0 = 1`.
2. **Check Evenness**: If `n` is **not** even (`n & 1` evaluates to `true`), return `false`.
3. **Iterate & Multiply**:
   - Start with `res = 2`.
   - Multiply `res` by `2` repeatedly until `res >= n`.
   - If `res == n`, return `true`, else return `false`.

## 📝 Code Implementation

```javascript
var isPowerOfTwo = function (n) {
    if (n == 1) return true;

    if (!(n & 1)) { // Check if n is even
        let res = 2;
        while (res < n) {
            res *= 2;
        }
        if (res == n) return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`, since we keep multiplying `res` by `2` until it reaches `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we use only a few variables.

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- **Negative numbers (`n < 0`)** → Always return `false`.
- **Zero (`n == 0`)** → Should return `false`.
- **Very large numbers** → The loop should efficiently handle large values.

---

## 🎯 Summary
- This function efficiently checks if a number is a power of two using **bitwise operations** and **iteration**.
- It works for all positive integers and handles edge cases effectively. 🚀
