# üå≤ Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree

## üí° Intuition
The goal is to find the **maximum path sum** in a binary tree. A path can start and end at any node in the tree and must follow the parent-child connections.

Each node contributes either through:
- Just the node itself.
- Node + one child.
- Node + both children (which can form a potential max path through this node).

We recursively explore all possibilities and track the **maximum sum**.

## üöÄ Approach: DFS (Postorder Traversal)

### üìå Steps
1. Initialize a global variable `sum` to hold the maximum path sum found.
2. Use a helper function `findSum(root)` to recursively calculate the maximum gain from each subtree.
3. At each node:
   - Recursively calculate max gain from left and right subtrees.
   - If the gain is negative, treat it as 0 (we skip it).
   - Update the global `sum` with `left + right + root.val` (path through the node).
   - Return the max path sum **starting from this node** going down either left or right.
4. Return the final value of `sum`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code
```javascript
const maxPathSum = root => {
    if(!root) return;

    let sum = -Infinity;

    function findSum(root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        let left = Math.max(0, findSum(root.left));
        let right = Math.max(0, findSum(root.right));

        sum  = Math.max(sum, left + right + root.val);

        return Math.max(left, right) + root.val;
    }

    findSum(root);
    return sum;
};
```

## üîç Dry Run
### Example Tree
```
        -10
        /  \
       9   20
          /  \
         15   7
```

- Left subtree (9): max gain = 9
- Right subtree:
  - 15 and 7 contribute to a max of 42 (15+20+7)

So max path = 15 + 20 + 7 = **42**

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes (every node is visited once).
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).

---

## üìò Summary
- We use DFS to compute max path sums from bottom-up.
- At each node, compute max gain and update a global max.
- Smart handling of negative paths ensures correctness.

‚úÖ Efficient and powerful approach for this classic tree problem!
