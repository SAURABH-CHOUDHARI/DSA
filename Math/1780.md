# 🚀 Check if a Number is a Sum of Distinct Powers of Three

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, determine whether it can be represented as a sum of **distinct powers of three**.

### ✅ Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^7`

## 🏆 Examples

```javascript
Input: n = 12
Output: true
Explanation: 12 = 3^1 + 3^2 (3 + 9 = 12)
```

```javascript
Input: n = 91
Output: true
Explanation: 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4 (1 + 9 + 81 = 91)
```

```javascript
Input: n = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three.
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach
### 🔄 Steps:
1. **Iterate through `n` while reducing it by powers of 3**:
   - Check if the remainder when divided by `3` is greater than `1`.
   - If yes, return `false` because the number cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three.
2. **Keep dividing `n` by `3`** to check further.
3. **Return `true` if the loop completes without breaking**.

## 📝 Code Implementation
```javascript
var checkPowersOfThree = function(n) {
    let num = n;
    while (num > 3) {
        let rem = num % 3;
        if (rem > 1) return false;
        num = Math.floor(num / 3);
    }
    if (num == 2) return false;
    return true;
};
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` since we keep dividing `n` by `3`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as we only use a few integer variables.

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- **Smallest `n` values** (`n = 1, 2, 3`)
- **Numbers that contain only powers of 3** (`n = 3, 9, 27, ...`)
- **Numbers with intermediate values that fail the condition (`n = 21, 22, 31`)**

### 🎯 Summary
This solution efficiently checks if a number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three using a simple iterative approach. 🚀
