# 📅 Beautiful Days - Optimal Solution

## � Problem Description
Given a range of days from `i` to `j`, count how many "beautiful days" exist where the absolute difference between the day and its reverse is divisible by `k`.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
This solution uses:
1. **Day iteration** through the given range
2. **Number reversal** using arithmetic operations
3. **Absolute difference** calculation
4. **Divisibility check** with the given `k` value

## 🚀 Optimal Implementation
```go
func reverseNumber(n int32) int32 {
    var rev int32 = 0
    temp := n
    for temp > 0 {
        rev = rev*10 + temp%10
        temp /= 10
    }
    return rev
}

func beautifulDays(i int32, j int32, k int32) int32 {
    count := int32(0)

    for day := i; day <= j; day++ {
        rev := reverseNumber(day)
        diff := day - rev
        if diff < 0 {
            diff = -diff
        }

        if diff%k == 0 {
            count++
        }
    }

    return count
}
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n × d)
  - Where n is the number of days (j - i + 1)
  - d is the average number of digits in the numbers
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Uses constant space for variables

## 📊 Example Walkthrough
**Input:**
```go
i = 20, j = 23, k = 6
```

**Execution:**
1. Day 20:
   - Reverse: 02 → 2
   - Difference: |20-2| = 18
   - 18%6 = 0 → beautiful day (count=1)
2. Day 21:
   - Reverse: 12
   - Difference: |21-12| = 9
   - 9%6 ≠ 0 → not beautiful
3. Day 22:
   - Reverse: 22
   - Difference: 0
   - 0%6 = 0 → beautiful day (count=2)
4. Day 23:
   - Reverse: 32
   - Difference: |23-32| = 9
   - 9%6 ≠ 0 → not beautiful

**Output:** `2`

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **Number Reversal**:
   - Efficiently done using modulo and division operations
2. **Absolute Difference**:
   - Important to handle both positive and negative cases
3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - Simple modulo operation determines beautiful days

## 🌟 Why This Solution Rocks
- Straightforward implementation
- Efficient number reversal without string conversion
- Clear logic flow
- Handles all edge cases (single day ranges, large numbers)

## 🏆 Alternative Approaches
1. **String Reversal**:
   ```go
   // Convert number to string, reverse, then convert back
   // Less efficient due to string operations
   ```
2. **Math.Abs Alternative**:
   ```go
   // Could use absolute value function if available
   // Makes code slightly cleaner
   ```

The arithmetic reversal solution provides an efficient and clean way to solve this problem!
