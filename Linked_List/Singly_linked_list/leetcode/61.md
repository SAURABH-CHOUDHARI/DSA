# 🔄 Rotate Linked List to the Right

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given a linked list, rotate the list to the **right** by `k` places.

## 🏆 Examples

### Example 1:
```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
Explanation: Rotating the list by 2 places results in shifting 4 and 5 to the front.
```

### Example 2:
```javascript
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
Explanation: Rotating by 4 places is equivalent to rotating by 1 place.
```

## 🛠 Approach

### ✅ Steps to Solve:
1. **Find the Length**:
   - Traverse the linked list to calculate its length (`size`).
   
2. **Optimize k**:
   - Since rotating by `size` is the same as no rotation, we take `k % size`.
   
3. **Find the Rotation Point**:
   - Use two pointers, `first` and `second`.
   - Move `second` `r` steps ahead (`r = k % size`).
   - Then, move both pointers one step at a time until `second` reaches the last node.
   
4. **Perform the Rotation**:
   - Break the list at the new tail (`first` pointer).
   - Connect the last node to the old head.
   - Update the head to the new starting point.

## 📝 Code Implementation

```javascript
var rotateRight = function (head, k) {
    if(!head) return null; // Edge case: Empty list
    
    let cur = head;
    let size = 0;
    while (cur) {
        size++;
        cur = cur.next;
    }
    
    let r = k % size; // Optimize k
    if (r === 0) return head; // No rotation needed
    
    cur = head;
    let first = head;
    let second = head;
    
    // Move second pointer r steps ahead
    for (let i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        second = second.next;
    }
    
    // Move both pointers until second reaches the last node
    while (second.next) {
        second = second.next;
        first = first.next;
    }
    
    // Perform rotation
    second.next = head;
    head = first.next;
    first.next = null;
    
    return head;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### **Input**: `[1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 2`

| Step | `first` Pointer | `second` Pointer | List Status |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Initial | `1` | `1` | `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` |
| Move `second` 2 steps | `1` | `3` | `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` |
| Move both pointers | `2` | `4` | `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` |
| Move both pointers | `3` | `5` | `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` |
| **Rotation** | `4` becomes new head | `5` connects to `1` | `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` |

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the linked list (single traversal).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no extra space is used.

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- **Empty List** → Return `null`.
- **Single Node** → Return the same node.
- **k is 0** → No rotation needed.
- **k is a multiple of list size** → No change in list.
- **k is greater than size** → Optimized using `k % size`.

## 🎯 Summary
- Find the length of the list 📏
- Optimize `k` using modulo `%` 🧮
- Use two-pointer technique 🎯
- Rotate by adjusting pointers 🔄

This approach efficiently rotates the linked list in `O(n)` time! 🚀🔥
