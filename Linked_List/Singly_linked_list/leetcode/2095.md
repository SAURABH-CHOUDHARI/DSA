# 🚀 Remove N-th Node from End of Linked List

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given a linked list, remove the **N-th node from the end** of the list and return its head.

## 🏆 Examples

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: The 2nd node from the end (4) is removed.
```

```javascript
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: The only node is removed, returning an empty list.
```

## 🛠 Solution 1: Two-Pointer Approach
### 🔄 Approach
1. Use a **dummy node** to handle edge cases smoothly.
2. Maintain two pointers: **first** and **second**.
3. Move the **first pointer** `n+1` steps ahead.
4. Move both pointers together until **first reaches null**.
5. Remove the target node by updating `second.next`.

### 📝 Code
```javascript
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    
    let first = dummy;
    let second = dummy;
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        first = first.next;
    }
    
    while (first !== null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    
    second.next = second.next.next;
    
    return dummy.next;
};
```
### ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, as we traverse the list twice.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we use only two extra pointers.

## 🛠 Solution 2: Iterative Count Approach
### 🔄 Approach
1. Count the **size of the list**.
2. Identify the node **before the N-th node**.
3. Adjust the `next` pointer to remove the target node.
4. Handle cases where the **first node** is removed.

### 📝 Code
```javascript
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    if (head.next == null) return null;
    
    let size = 0;
    let cur = head;
    while (cur) {
        cur = cur.next;
        size++;
    }
    
    const stop = size - n;
    if (stop == 0) return head.next;
    
    let start = head;
    for (let i = 1; i < stop; i++) {
       start = start.next;
    }
    
    if (start.next == null) return head;
    if (start.next.next == null) {
        start.next = null;
        return head;
    }
    
    start.next = start.next.next;
    return head;
};
```
### ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, since we traverse the list twice.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we use only a few variables.

## 🛠 Solution 3: Delete Middle Node
### 🔄 Approach
1. Use a **dummy node** for edge case handling.
2. Maintain two pointers: **fast** and **slow**.
3. Move **fast** two steps at a time and **slow** one step at a time.
4. When **fast** reaches the end, **slow** is at the middle.
5. Remove the middle node by adjusting `slow.next`.

### 📝 Code
```javascript
var deleteMiddle = function(head) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let fast = dummy.next;
    let slow = dummy;
    
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    
    slow.next = slow.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
};
```
### ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, as we traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we use only two extra pointers.

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- **Single-node list (`n == 1`)** → Should return `null`.
- **Removing the first node** → Special handling is required.
- **Removing the last node** → Ensure pointer updates correctly.
- **`n` equals list length** → Handle when `n` removes the head node.
- **Deleting middle in even-length list** → Ensure correct mid-point selection.

## 🎯 Summary
The three solutions efficiently handle linked list node removal. 🚀
- **Two-pointer method** is optimal for removing the N-th node from the end.
- **Iterative count method** is straightforward but requires an extra pass.
- **Middle node deletion** efficiently finds and removes the center.

Choose the best approach based on readability and performance needs! 🎯🔥
