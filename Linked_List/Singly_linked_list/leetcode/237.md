# 🔄 Delete a Node in a Linked List

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given access to a node (not the head) in a linked list, delete that node from the list in `O(1)` time complexity.

## 🔍 Example

```javascript
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4], node = 3
Output: [1,2,4]
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

1. **Modify the Given Node**: Since we don’t have access to the previous node, copy the value of the next node into the current node.
2. **Update Pointers**: Make the current node point to `node.next.next`, effectively removing the next node.
3. **No Need for Traversal**: The operation is performed in constant time `O(1)`.

## 📝 Code Implementation

```javascript
var deleteNode = function (node) {
    if (node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
};
```

## 🛠 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we modify only one node.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since no extra space is used.

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered

- The node to be deleted is the last node (this method does not work for that case).
- The list contains only one node (not a valid input as per problem constraints).
- The node is in the middle of the list.

## 🎯 Summary

This function efficiently deletes a node in constant time without requiring traversal from the head. 🚀
