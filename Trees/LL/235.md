# ✅ Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

## 💡 Intuition
The Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes `p` and `q` in a BST is the deepest (lowest) node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants.

Because of the **BST property** (left < root < right), we can use this to our advantage.

We’ll discuss **two different approaches** to solve this:
- **Iterative** method
- **Recursive** method

---

## 🚀 Approach 1: Iterative
### 📌 Steps
1. Start from the root and traverse down.
2. If both `p` and `q` are greater than current node, move to the **right**.
3. If both are smaller, move to the **left**.
4. Else, we’ve found the split point (or exact match), and that’s the LCA.

### 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var lowestCommonAncestor = function (root, p, q) {
    let curr = root;
    while (curr) {
        if (curr.val === p.val || curr.val === q.val) return curr;

        if (p.val > curr.val && q.val > curr.val) {
            curr = curr.right;
        } else if (p.val < curr.val && q.val < curr.val) {
            curr = curr.left;
        } else {
            return curr;
        }
    }
};
```

---

### 🔍 Dry Run
Given BST:
```
       6
      / \
     2   8
    / \ / \
   0  4 7 9
     / \
    3   5
```
Let `p = 2`, `q = 8`
- Start at 6 → `p < 6 && q > 6` → split → return 6

Let `p = 2`, `q = 4`
- Start at 6 → both < 6 → move to 2
- At 2 → `p = 2`, `q = 4` → split → return 2

---

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time:** O(H) where H = height of BST
- **Space:** O(1) (no recursion stack)

---

## 🚀 Approach 2: Recursive
### 📌 Steps
1. If root is `null`, return `null`.
2. If both values are less than root, recurse on **left**.
3. If both values are greater than root, recurse on **right**.
4. Else, root is LCA.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var lowestCommonAncestor = function (root, p, q) {
    if (!root) return null;

    if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    return root;
};
```

---

### 🔍 Dry Run
Same BST as above:
```
       6
      / \
     2   8
    / \ / \
   0  4 7 9
     / \
    3   5
```
Let `p = 0`, `q = 5`
- root = 6 → both < 6 → recurse left to 2
- root = 2 → 0 < 2 && 5 > 2 → split → return 2

---

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time:** O(H)
- **Space:** O(H) for recursion stack

---

## 📘 Summary
- BST properties allow fast LCA detection.
- **Iterative** method is space-optimized.
- **Recursive** method is cleaner and intuitive.
- Both have the same time complexity of `O(H)` where `H` is tree height. ✅
