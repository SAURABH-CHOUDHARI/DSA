# 📍 K Closest Points to Origin

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given an array of points `points` where `points[i] = [xᵢ, yᵢ]` represents a point on a 2D plane, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

### Example
```javascript
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
- Distance of [1,3] = √10 ≈ 3.16
- Distance of [-2,2] = √8 ≈ 2.83
- The closest point is [-2,2]
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach

### Distance Calculation with Sorting
1. **Distance Mapping**: Calculate squared distance for each point (avoiding sqrt for efficiency)
2. **Sorting**: Sort points by their computed distances
3. **Result Extraction**: Select first `k` elements from sorted array

## 💻 Code Implementation

```javascript
var kClosest = function(points, k) {
    // Create map of points to their squared distances
    const distanceMap = new Map();
    points.forEach(point => {
        const [x, y] = point;
        distanceMap.set(point, x*x + y*y);
    });
    
    // Sort points by distance and take first k
    return Array.from(distanceMap)
        .sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1])
        .slice(0, k)
        .map(item => item[0]);
};
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N)  
  (Dominant term is the sorting operation)
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)  
  (Storage for distance map and sorted array)

## 🏁 Example Walkthrough

### Input: `points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]]`, `k = 2`
1. Distance calculation:
   - [3,3] → 9+9=18
   - [5,-1] → 25+1=26
   - [-2,4] → 4+16=20
2. Sorting:
   - [[3,3],18], [[-2,4],20], [[5,-1],26]
3. First 2 points:
   - [[3,3], [-2,4]]
4. **Output**: `[[3,3],[-2,4]]`

## ✅ Edge Cases Handled

- **k equals array length**: Returns all points
- **Duplicate distances**: Maintains original order
- **Points on axes**: e.g., [0,5] or [3,0]
- **Origin included**: [0,0] will always be first if present
- **Large coordinates**: Handles maximum integer values

## 🎯 Optimization Notes

- **Squared distance**: Avoids computationally expensive sqrt
- **Map storage**: Preserves original point references
- **Clean chaining**: Readable method composition

## 🚀 Alternative Approaches

1. **Max Heap**:
   ```javascript
   // Maintain heap of size k
   // O(N log k) time complexity
   ```
2. **Quickselect**:
   ```javascript
   // O(N) average case, O(N²) worst case
   // More complex but theoretically faster
   ```
3. **Binary Search**:
   ```javascript
   // Search for distance threshold
   // O(N log D) where D is distance range
   ```

This implementation provides a straightforward solution that balances readability with performance for typical problem constraints. For very large `N` and small `k`, consider the max heap approach for better efficiency.
