# 🌲 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

## 💡 Problem Statement
Given a **perfect binary tree**, populate each node's `next` pointer to point to its **next right node**. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `null`. The tree is perfect — all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.

---

## 🔍 DFS Approach (Recursive)

### 💡 Intuition
In a perfect binary tree:
- Every node has two children unless it's a leaf.
- The `next` pointer of a node’s **left child** should point to the **right child**.
- The `next` pointer of a node’s **right child** should point to the **left child of its parent’s next** (if exists).

We can use **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to recursively connect these pointers.

---

## 🚀 Steps
1. If the current node or its left child is null, return.
2. Connect the left child to the right child.
3. If current node has a `next`, connect right child to the left child of the next node.
4. Recursively call the helper on left and right subtrees.

---

## ✅ Code (DFS)
```javascript
var connect = function (root) {
    if (!root) return null;

    function helper(root) {
        if (!root || !root.left) return;

        root.left.next = root.right;

        if (root.next) {
            root.right.next = root.next.left;
        }

        helper(root.left);
        helper(root.right);
    }

    helper(root);
    return root;
};
```

## 🔁 Dry Run
```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
```
### After running:
- 2.next → 3
- 4.next → 5
- 5.next → 6
- 6.next → 7

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time:** O(N) — visit every node once.
- **Space:** O(H) — due to recursion stack. H = height of tree = log N for perfect binary tree.

---

## 🔄 BFS Approach (Iterative)

### 💡 Intuition
We use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** with a queue to connect each level.

---

## 🚀 Steps
1. Push root to the queue.
2. While queue is not empty:
   - Traverse current level using `for` loop.
   - For each node:
     - If it’s not the first node, set previous node’s `next` to current node.
     - Enqueue its left and right child.
   - Set `next` of the last node in level to null.

---

## ✅ Code (BFS)
```javascript
var connect = function (root) {
    if (!root) return null;

    let q = [root];

    while (q.length) {
        let size = q.length;
        let prev = null;

        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            let node = q[i];

            if (prev) prev.next = node;
            prev = node;

            if (node.left) q.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) q.push(node.right);
        }

        prev.next = null;
        q.splice(0, size);
    }

    return root;
};
```

## 🔁 Dry Run
```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
```
### Connections created:
- 2 → 3
- 4 → 5 → 6 → 7

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time:** O(N)
- **Space:** O(N) — due to queue usage in BFS.

## 📌 DFS vs BFS
| Feature       | DFS                        | BFS                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Style         | Recursive                  | Iterative                   |
| Space         | O(H) (stack)               | O(N) (queue)                |
| Readability   | Clean and elegant          | More explicit with control  |
| Use Case      | Perfect binary trees       | All tree types              |

---

## ✅ Summary
Both solutions work for **perfect binary trees**. DFS is elegant and efficient in space. BFS is easier to understand for level-wise operations.
