# 📌 Add Two Numbers (Linked List)  

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.  

You may assume the two numbers **do not contain any leading zeros**, except the number `0` itself.  

## 🏆 Example  

### Example 1:  
```javascript
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

### Example 2:  
```javascript
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Explanation: 0 + 0 = 0.
```

### Example 3:  
```javascript
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
Explanation: 9999999 + 9999 = 10009998.
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach  

### 🔄 Steps  
1. **Extract numbers from linked lists**: Traverse both linked lists and store digits as strings in reverse order.  
2. **Convert strings to BigInt**: Since numbers can be large, use `BigInt`.  
3. **Compute the sum**: Add the two numbers.  
4. **Convert sum back to linked list**: Iterate through the sum and create a new linked list with digits stored in reverse order.

## 📝 Code Implementation  
```javascript
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    let cur1 = l1;
    let cur2 = l2;
    let num1 = "";
    let num2 = ""; 
    
    while (cur1) {
        num1 = cur1.val + num1; 
        cur1 = cur1.next;
    }
    
    while (cur2) {
        num2 = cur2.val + num2; 
        cur2 = cur2.next;
    }
    
    let sum = BigInt(num1) + BigInt(num2);
    
    if (sum === 0n) {
        return new ListNode(0);
    }
    
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummy;
    
    let sumStr = sum.toString();
    
    for (let i = sumStr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        current.next = new ListNode(parseInt(sumStr[i]));
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
};
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N + M)`, where `N` and `M` are the lengths of the two linked lists.  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(max(N, M))`, as we store numbers in string form and then create a new linked list.  

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered  
- **One list is longer than the other** (e.g., `[9,9,9]` and `[1]`).  
- **Lists contain zeros** (e.g., `[0]` and `[0]`).  
- **Large numbers that exceed JavaScript’s Number limit** (handled using `BigInt`).  

---

## 🎯 Summary  
✅ Uses **BigInt** to handle large sums.  
✅ Extracts numbers efficiently from linked lists.  
✅ Constructs a new linked list for the result.  
✅ Handles edge cases gracefully.  

🚀 **Optimal solution for adding numbers in linked list representation!** 🎉
