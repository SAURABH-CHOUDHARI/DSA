# 🌳 Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

## 💡 Intuition
- In a **postorder** traversal, the **last** node is the **root**.
- In an **inorder** traversal, the elements to the **left** of the root are in the **left subtree**, and the elements to the **right** are in the **right subtree**.
- By using a hashmap for quick index lookups in the inorder array and working **backward** through the postorder array, we can reconstruct the tree efficiently.

---

## 📌 Steps
1. Create a `Map` of inorder values to their indices for O(1) lookups.
2. Maintain a global pointer `i` starting at the end of the postorder array.
3. Write a recursive function `solve(s, e)` to construct the tree for inorder range `s` to `e`.
4. For each call:
   - Pick the element at `postorder[i]` as root and decrement `i`.
   - Use the hashmap to find its index in the inorder array.
   - **Recurse to the right first**, then left, because postorder is root-right-left when reversed.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var buildTree = function (inorder, postorder) {
    let i = postorder.length - 1;
    let map = new Map();

    for (let j = 0; j < inorder.length; j++) {
        map.set(inorder[j], j);
    }

    var solve = function (s, e) {
        if (s > e) return null;

        let val = postorder[i--];
        let node = new TreeNode(val);

        let idx = map.get(val);

        node.right = solve(idx + 1, e);
        node.left = solve(s, idx - 1);

        return node;
    };

    return solve(0, inorder.length - 1);
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
Input:
```
Inorder:   [9,3,15,20,7]
Postorder: [9,15,7,20,3]
```

Steps:
- Start with postorder[4] = 3 ➔ root
- Find 3 in inorder at index 1
- Recurse on right (inorder[2:4]) ➔ root is 20
- Recurse on left (inorder[0:0]) ➔ root is 9

Resulting Tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9   20
     /  \
    15   7
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Each node is processed once.
  - Map lookups are constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - For the hashmap and recursion stack.

---

## 📘 Summary
This method efficiently reconstructs the binary tree by:
- Using the last element of postorder as the root.
- Looking up root index in inorder using a map.
- Building right subtree before left due to postorder’s nature.

This is an optimal solution for the given problem with linear time and space complexity.
