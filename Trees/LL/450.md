# ❌ Delete a Node in a Binary Search Tree

## 💡 Intuition
To delete a node in a BST, we need to handle three cases:
1. Node has no children (leaf): simply remove it.
2. Node has one child: replace it with its child.
3. Node has two children: find the **inorder successor** (smallest value in the right subtree), copy its value to the current node, and delete the inorder successor.

We use recursion to find the node and restructure the tree accordingly.

## 🚀 Approach: Recursive Deletion

### 📌 Steps
1. Traverse the BST to find the node with `key`.
2. Once found, handle the 3 deletion cases:
   - No child → return `null`
   - One child → return the non-null child
   - Two children:
     - Find inorder successor in right subtree
     - Replace node’s value with successor’s value
     - Delete the successor node from right subtree

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var deleteNode = function (root, key) {
    if (!root) return null;

    if (key > root.val) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
    else if (key < root.val) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
    else {
        if (!root.left) return root.right;
        else if (!root.right) return root.left;

        let cur = root.right;
        while (cur.left) {
            cur = cur.left;
        }
        root.val = cur.val;
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.val);
    }
    return root;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Input
```
BST:
      5
     / \
    3   6
   / \   \
  2   4   7
key = 3
```
### Execution
- Start at 5 → 3 < 5 → go left
- At 3 → found node to delete
- Node 3 has two children → find inorder successor (4)
- Replace 3 with 4 → delete 4 from right subtree
- Tree becomes:
```
      5
     / \
    4   6
   /     \
  2       7
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) for recursion stack

## 📘 Summary
- Efficiently deletes a node while maintaining BST properties.
- Handles all three deletion cases.
- Uses recursion for clarity.

✅ Elegant and efficient BST deletion!
