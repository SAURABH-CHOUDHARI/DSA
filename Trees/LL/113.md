### 🌿 Path Sum II - Root-to-Leaf Paths Matching Target Sum

## 💡 Intuition
In this variant, we aim to **collect all root-to-leaf paths** in the binary tree where the **sum of node values equals the target sum**. A path must **start at the root and end at a leaf**.

This is a classic DFS traversal problem where we maintain a **running sum** and a **current path** during recursion.

---

## 🚀 Approach
We use recursive **DFS traversal**, maintaining:
- `sum`: the accumulated sum of node values on the current path.
- `cur`: an array storing the actual path.
- `ans`: a list of all valid paths found so far.

---

## 📌 Steps
1. Start DFS traversal from the root.
2. At each node:
   - Add the node’s value to the current sum and path.
   - If the node is a **leaf** and the sum equals `targetSum`, push the path into `ans`.
   - Recur for left and right children.
   - **Backtrack** by removing the node from the current path.
3. Return the collected paths.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var pathSum = function (root, targetSum) {
    let ans = [];
    if (!root) return [];

    var solve = function (node, sum, cur) {
        if (!node) return;

        cur.push(node.val);
        sum += node.val;

        if (!node.left && !node.right && sum === targetSum) {
            ans.push([...cur]);
        }

        solve(node.left, sum, cur);
        solve(node.right, sum, cur);

        cur.pop(); // backtrack
    };

    solve(root, 0, []);
    return ans;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run

### Tree Example
```
       5
      / \
     4   8
    /   / \
   11 13  4
  /  \     \
 7    2     1
```

### Target Sum = 22

### Valid Path:
- 5 → 4 → 11 → 2

✅ Output: `[[5, 4, 11, 2]]`

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N^2)` in the worst case — each path could be length N and copied to the answer list.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)` for recursion stack + space used by `cur` (H = height of tree).

---

## 🎯 Summary
- Clean recursive solution using DFS.
- Collects valid paths while backtracking.
- Solves the "Path Sum II" variant where only **root-to-leaf** paths count.
