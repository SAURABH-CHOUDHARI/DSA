# 🚗 Car Fleet Simulation

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given a target destination and arrays of car positions and speeds, determine how many fleets will arrive at the destination. Cars cannot pass each other - they form fleets when a faster car catches up to a slower one.

### Example
```javascript
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Cars at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet at 12
- Car at 5 (speed 1) becomes a fleet
- Cars at 3 (speed 3) and 0 (speed 1) become a fleet
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach

### Time-to-Target Calculation
1. **Position Mapping**:
   - Create array mapping positions to arrival times
2. **Fleet Detection**:
   - Scan from farthest position
   - New fleet forms when a car arrives later than current fleet

## 💻 Code Implementation

```javascript
var carFleet = function(target, position, speed) {
    // Find maximum position to size our array
    const maxPos = Math.max(...position);
    const timeToTarget = new Array(maxPos + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Calculate time needed to reach target for each position
    for (let i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
        timeToTarget[position[i]] = (target - position[i]) / speed[i];
    }
    
    let fleets = 0;
    let currentFleetTime = 0;
    
    // Check from farthest to nearest position
    for (let pos = maxPos; pos >= 0; pos--) {
        // Only consider positions that have cars
        if (timeToTarget[pos] > 0) {
            // New fleet forms if this car arrives after current fleet
            if (timeToTarget[pos] > currentFleetTime) {
                currentFleetTime = timeToTarget[pos];
                fleets++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return fleets;
};
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N + P)  
  (N = number of cars, P = maximum position)
- **Space Complexity**: O(P)  
  (Storage for position-time array)

## 🏁 Example Walkthrough

### Input: `target=10`, `position=[6,8]`, `speed=[3,2]`
1. `maxPos = 8`
2. `timeToTarget`:
   - position 6: (10-6)/3 = 1.33
   - position 8: (10-8)/2 = 1.00
3. Backward scan:
   - pos 8: time=1.00 → new fleet (fleets=1)
   - pos 6: time=1.33 > 1.00 → new fleet (fleets=2)
4. **Result**: 2

## ✅ Edge Cases Handled

- **Single car**: Returns 1
- **All same speed**: Forms one fleet if positions allow
- **Immediate arrival**: Handles zero speed
- **Large target**: Handles big numbers
- **Empty input**: Returns 0

## 🎯 Optimization Notes

- **Position bucketing**: Efficient time calculation
- **Single pass**: O(P) scan after setup
- **Early exit**: Could break when position < 0
- **Memory efficient**: Only stores necessary positions

## 🚀 Alternative Approaches

1. **Pair Sorting**:
   ```javascript
   // Sort position-speed pairs
   // Compare adjacent times
   // O(N log N) time
   ```
2. **Stack-Based**:
   ```javascript
   // Use stack to track fleet times
   // More space-efficient for sparse positions
   ```
3. **Event Simulation**:
   ```javascript
   // Simulate car movements
   // More intuitive but less efficient
   ```

This implementation provides an efficient solution that clearly demonstrates the fleet formation logic while handling all edge cases properly. The position-based approach is particularly effective when the position range is reasonable.
