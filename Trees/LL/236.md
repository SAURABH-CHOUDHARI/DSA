# 🌳 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## 💡 Intuition
The **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree is defined as the deepest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (a node can be a descendant of itself).

To find the LCA, we use **postorder DFS traversal**: we explore the left and right subtrees first, and use their return values to determine whether we've found `p`, `q`, or the LCA.

---

## 🚀 Approach
We recursively traverse the tree and apply the following logic:

1. If the current node is `null`, return `null`.
2. If the current node matches either `p` or `q`, return the current node.
3. Recursively search the left and right subtrees.
4. If both left and right return non-null, the current node is the LCA.
5. Otherwise, return whichever side is non-null.

---

## 📌 Steps
1. Start DFS from the root.
2. For each node:
   - Check if it's `null` or matches `p` or `q`.
   - Recurse left and right.
   - Use the return values to determine if current node is the LCA.
3. Return the node that is the lowest common ancestor.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var lowestCommonAncestor = function (root, p, q) {
    if (!root) return null;
    if (root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) return root;

    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    if (!left) return right;
    if (!right) return left;
    return root;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Tree:
```
        3
       / \
      5   1
     / \ / \
    6  2 0  8
      / \
     7   4
```
### p = 5, q = 1
- Left returns node 5
- Right returns node 1
- LCA is root (3)

### p = 5, q = 4
- Left subtree explores 5, finds 4 in its subtree
- LCA is node 5

✅ Works correctly!

## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` — visits each node once
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)` — recursion stack, `H` is the height of the tree

---

## 🎯 Summary
- Simple and elegant recursive DFS
- Returns as soon as both nodes are found
- Efficient for general binary trees, not just BSTs

Perfect approach for interviews and practical usage! 🚀
