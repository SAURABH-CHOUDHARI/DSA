# 🚀 Is Power of Four

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of four, otherwise return `false`.

A number is a power of four if it can be expressed as `4^x` where `x` is a non-negative integer.

## 🏆 Examples

```javascript
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 16 = 4^2
```

```javascript
Input: n = 5
Output: false
Explanation: 5 is not a power of four.
```

```javascript
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 = 4^0
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach

1. **Base Case:** If `n == 1`, return `true` (since `4^0 = 1`).
2. **Divisibility Check:** If `n` is divisible by `4`, initialize a variable `res = 4` and keep multiplying it by `4` until `res >= n`.
3. **Final Check:** If `res == n`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## 📝 Code Implementation
```javascript
var isPowerOfFour = function(n) {
    if(n == 1) return true;
    if(n % 4 === 0){
        let res = 4;
        while(res < n){
            res *= 4;
        }
        if(res == n) return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`, since we repeatedly divide `n` by `4`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use a few extra variables.

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- `n = 1` (smallest power of four)
- `n` is a negative number → should return `false`
- `n` is not a power of four but a power of two (e.g., `8`)
- `n = 0`, should return `false`

---

## 🎯 Summary
- **Efficient approach** using iterative multiplication.
- **Handles edge cases** like negative numbers and non-power-of-four values.
- **Optimized for space** with `O(1)` complexity.

🔥 This solution effectively determines whether a number is a power of four! 🚀
