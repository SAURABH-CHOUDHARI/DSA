# 🌲 Diameter of Binary Tree

## 💡 Intuition
The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length of the longest path** between any two nodes. This path **may or may not pass through the root**. The goal is to calculate this maximum path length.

The path length is determined by the number of edges (not nodes) between the farthest pair of leaf nodes.

To solve this, we can use **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to compute the depth of each subtree and simultaneously track the diameter.

## 🚀 Approach
We use recursion with a helper function `solve(root)` that:
1. Returns `0` if the node is null (base case).
2. Recursively finds the **depth** of the left and right subtrees.
3. Calculates the diameter at that node as `left + right`.
4. Updates the global `max` if the current diameter is greater.
5. Returns the **height** of the subtree for further recursive calls.

Finally, return the global maximum diameter.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var diameterOfBinaryTree = function (root) {
    let max = 0;

    var solve = function (root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        let left = solve(root.left);
        let right = solve(root.right);

        // Update max diameter at this node
        max = Math.max(max, left + right);

        // Return height
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    };

    solve(root);
    return max;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Example Tree
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```
### Step-by-Step
- Node `4` and `5`: return 1 (leaf nodes)
- Node `2`: left = 1 (from `4`), right = 1 (from `5`) → max = 2
- Node `3`: returns 1
- Node `1`: left = 2, right = 1 → max = 3

🔚 **Final Output:** `3`

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` — Every node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)` — Where `H` is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).

## 🎯 Summary
- Utilized DFS to compute depth and track max diameter.
- Smart use of post-order traversal for max path calculation.
- Efficient and elegant `O(N)` solution.
