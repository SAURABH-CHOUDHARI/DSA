# 🚀 Odd-Even Linked List

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list, group all the **odd-indexed** nodes together followed by the **even-indexed** nodes and return the reordered list.

**Note:** The relative order inside both the odd and even groups should remain the same.

---

## 🏆 Example

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
Explanation: Odd-indexed nodes (1,3,5) are placed first, followed by even-indexed nodes (2,4).
```

```javascript
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

## 🛠 Solution Approach
### 🔄 Approach
1. **Edge Case Handling:** If the list is empty (`head == null`), return `null`.
2. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - `odd` starts at the first node.
   - `even` starts at the second node.
   - `evenHead` stores the starting node of the even list.
3. **Rearrange Nodes:**
   - Iterate through the list while ensuring both `odd.next` and `even.next` exist.
   - Link odd nodes together and move the `odd` pointer forward.
   - Link even nodes together and move the `even` pointer forward.
4. **Reattach Even List:** After the loop, attach the even list (`evenHead`) to the end of the odd list.
5. **Return the updated head.**

## 📝 Code Implementation
```javascript
var oddEvenList = function (head) {
    if (!head) return null;
    let odd = head;
    let even = head.next;
    let evenHead = even;
    while (odd.next && even.next) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }
    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
};
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We traverse the list once, reordering the nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - We modify the linked list in-place without using extra space.

---

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered
- **Empty list (`head == null`)** → Return `null`.
- **Single-node list** → No change is needed.
- **List with two nodes** → Already follows the odd-even pattern.
- **Even-length and odd-length lists** → Ensures correct reordering for both cases.

## 🎯 Summary
This solution efficiently groups **odd and even indexed nodes** while maintaining their relative order. 🚀🔥
