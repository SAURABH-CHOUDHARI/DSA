# 🌳 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

## 💡 Intuition
**Level Order Traversal** (also known as **Breadth-First Search**) processes nodes **level by level**, starting from the root and moving horizontally across each level before going to the next one. It's particularly useful when you want to:

- Print the tree level-wise
- Analyze tree structure level-by-level
- Apply operations that depend on depth

---

## 🚀 Approach
To achieve Level Order Traversal, we use a **queue**:

1. Initialize the queue with the root node.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (`lSize`).
   - Process each node at this level:
     - Dequeue it.
     - Push its value to a `level` array.
     - Enqueue its left and right children (if they exist).
   - Push the `level` array to the result.
3. Return the result array containing all levels.

## 🧑‍💻 Code
```javascript
var levelOrder = function(root) {
    const res = [];
    const bfs = startNode => {
        const q = [startNode];
        while(q.length) {
            const lSize = q.length;
            let level = [];
            for(let i = 0; i < lSize; i++) {
                const cur = q.shift();
                level.push(cur.val);
                if(cur.left) q.push(cur.left);
                if(cur.right) q.push(cur.right);
            };
            res.push(level);
        };
    };
    if(!root) return [];
    bfs(root);
    return res;
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run
### Example Tree
```
        3
       / \
      9  20
         /  \
        15   7
```

### Step-by-Step
- **Level 0**: [3]
- **Level 1**: [9, 20]
- **Level 2**: [15, 7]

🔚 **Final Output:** `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` — Each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` — For queue and result storage.

---

## 🎯 Summary
- This approach uses **BFS** to efficiently traverse each level.
- We maintain level grouping by controlling the loop using the queue size.
- Easy to adapt for related problems like zigzag traversal or right view.
