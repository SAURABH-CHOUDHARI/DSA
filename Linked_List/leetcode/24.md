# 🔄 Swap Nodes in Pairs

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return the modified list. The swapping should be done without modifying the values of the nodes, only changing their pointers.

## 🔍 Example

```javascript
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]

Input: head = []
Output: []

Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

1. **Use a Dummy Node**: Create a dummy node before the head to simplify pointer manipulation.
2. **Iterate Through the List**: Swap pairs of nodes while traversing.
3. **Pointer Manipulation**: Adjust the `next` pointers carefully to swap the nodes in pairs without losing references.

## 📝 Code Implementation

```javascript
var swapPairs = function (head) {
    const dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let cur = dummy;

    while (cur.next != null && cur.next.next != null) {
        let first = cur.next;
        let sec = cur.next.next;
        first.next = sec.next;
        cur.next = sec;
        cur.next.next = first;
        cur = cur.next.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
};
```

## 🛠 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we are modifying the list in place without using extra space.

## ✅ Edge Cases Considered

- The list is empty (`head == null`).
- The list has only one node (no swaps needed).
- The list has an even or odd number of nodes.
- All elements are the same.

## 🎯 Summary

This function efficiently swaps adjacent nodes in a linked list using pointer manipulation and a dummy node for simplicity. 🚀
